## ShedditUI

(ShedditUI)[https://github.com/rahulnpadalkar/ShedditUI] is a desktop application for Sheddit. So if you **don't want to interact with a server directly** then you can use ShedditUI. It has been released for macOS and Windows. It's also **free and open source.**

**NOTE: Sheddit UI is a mere desktop application, it still needs Sheddit server to function. So the below setup is required regardless.**

## Setup

There are a few configurations that need to be done.

 **NOTE: this is a script type app for reddit, so it has access only to developer's account, you can add more accounts from reddit app creation board**
 
 ### Get keys for reddit

1. Go to reddit's [app creation page](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
2. Create an app, remember to select **script** from the radio button menu.
3. Note down client secret and client id (both will appear in the app details once it is created)

### Get keys for twitter

1. Go to [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply) and apply for a developer account.
2. Fill in the application. Verify your email address by clicking on the link sent in verification mail by twitter (after you complete application).
3. After successful verification go to [create application dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and click on create app.
4. Fill in the application and hit create. (Filling only the required fields will suffice)
5. Upon completion, click on Keys and tokens tab and note down API key, API secret key, access token and access token secret. (Generate access token and access token secret if not already generated.)

### Creating a env file

(If you are using ShedditUI it .env file be generated by clicking on the first icon in the top right corner.)

1. Create .env file in the root of this projects directory (sample env file below)
  Sample .env file looks like this

    ```
      clientid=your-client-id-goes-here
      clientsecret=your-client-secret-goes-here
      useragent=sample-useragent
      username=your-reddit-username
      password=your-reddit-password
      auth_url=www.reddit.com
      secure_api=https://oauth.reddit.com/api
      t_consumerkey=twitter-api-key
      t_consumersecret=twitter-api-secret
      t_accesstoken=twitter-access-token
      t_accessecret=twitter-access-secret
      bucketname=any-string-is-fine
    ```

### Running the server

1. Run the program with the command `godotenv -f .env go run main.go`

## Supported endpoints

### schedulePost

Schedule a post for either twitter or reddit.

Example data for request:

      "scheduledate":"2020-03-06T10:46:00.000Z" (ISO DatetimeString)
      "provider":"twitter"||"reddit"
```

#### Things to remember

1. When the provider is **twitter**
    1. Text corresponds to the tweet text

2. When the provider is **reddit**
